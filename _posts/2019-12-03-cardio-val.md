My team at Aiomin Studios collaborated with Dr. Amalia Hosein to bring her research to life in the form of a mobile app available on Android, iOS and the web.

Dr. Hosein's research focused on cardiovascular health. She has developed algorithms specific to the population of Trinidad and Tobago that will allow a user to specify data about themselves and receive a CardioVal number that represents the individual's potential risk of developing a cardiovascular disease.

The project was executed rapidly, but produced a decent v1 that will allow Dr. Hosein and her team to continue their research.

Personally, I was glad to participate in this project as issues related to health, lifestyle diseases and personal responsibility are important to me and I'm glad to help push projects like this forward.
