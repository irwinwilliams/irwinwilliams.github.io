I saw this tweet the other day,

And I thought, hmm, that's pretty groovy.

What if a local newspaper created an API based on its news stories over the last few decades? I mean, a really rich one, that was semantically, very strong and well-linked, in a RESTful way.

You might have references to stories, to persons of interest, to events, countries and other entities. Using that, one could travel through history, or extrapolate into the future. One might make gamesÂ that used the API for content.

I'm going to come back to this idea, but I do think it's worth exploring.
