# The [FP Group](http://fpgroup.foreignpolicy.com/ "FP Group") provides global insight and analysis.  A friend had shared one of their articles with me, it listed, according to foreignpolicy.com, [the 500 most powerful people on the planet](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/29/the_500_most_powerful_people_in_the_world).

It was a pretty jive list, but it essentially was this table of 500 people.  I felt for such a list, you should be able to sort, filter and even get some sense of aggregate information on the countries listed.

So, I made a bookmarklet that would let me apply those features to the table they provided.

This is what it looked like after I was done:

As I wanted, you could now sort, filter or view a nice chart on the data presented.  All right from within the page, thus not having to navigate away.
