I mentioned [PSI](https://irwinium.wordpress.com/2022/02/28/situational-intel-fusing-running-falling-growing/) before. And I'm pretty sure I will again. Microsoft's Platform for Situated Intelligence has a lot of potential. I was reminded about it today with this tweet:

I'm sure people doing HoloLens2 development will be excited by this news. I am as well, but not just for the H2. I think the work on PSI will continue to enable fresh and innovative implementations with Microsoft Teams calls and meetings.

From the PSI lab, they released a great [demo](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-comms-samples/tree/master/Samples/PublicSamples/PsiBot) that I've spent some time playing with.

With PSI, you can access all the streams of a call, and then modify those streams before sending data back down through a call. I [took a while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjQmDisBg5U&t=9488s) to get started last time I build a POC, but with more use cases and data, I should get even better at it.

Once I do, I'll be pushing to show examples of applying deep intelligence during Teams calls. This should be fun!
