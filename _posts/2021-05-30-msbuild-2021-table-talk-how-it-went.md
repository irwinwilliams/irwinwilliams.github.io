In a [recent post](https://irwinium.wordpress.com/2021/05/14/msbuild-2021-teams-table-talk/) I mentioned moderating a table talk at this year's MSBuild along with Erik Kleefeldt.

By design, it's meant to be like a hallway chat with a bunch of people about tech we've been using/playing with/excited about. This hallway was huge. 318 people turned up on Teams to talk about extending it in some way or other.

Erik and I met with Anna, Andy and Joey from Microsoft in the preceding weeks, to get oriented, nail down a flow and just get a backstage peak at some of coordination it takes to pull off an event like Build. (Hint: It's a lot!).

We had a good idea about what we would do, I'd introduce, he'd conclude and stuff like that. And then when the meeting started, I had jitters, my machine had jitters and I wondered if we would actually get started at all. But then, I told all my new friends that I was super nervous and everything just settled down.

Top things we spoke about:

- Fluid Framework
- Viva Connections
- Upcoming Meetings and Calling API

As a hallway chat, like in real life, there's no recording, but those topics are great areas to explore further. I'm definitely looking forward to the new media API - to get me out of being [stuck in the middle](https://irwinium.wordpress.com/2021/05/24/in-media-res/) of my current project.

Overall, this was a lot of fun, [Build](https://youtu.be/b4ryyEm5rSc?t=10220) was plenty vibes & plenty action and I've got a lot of unpacking to do from my backpack.
