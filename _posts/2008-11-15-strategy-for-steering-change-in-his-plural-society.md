I happened to come across this article on google news:

Referring to early speculations as to how Obama would construct his first cabinet.

I was impressed by the deliberate sense of pragmatism in his choices. To me, pragmatism over partisanship.  In my country,  one would never expect the elected leader to even consider any kind of alignment withthe party who they lost against.  Yet, Obama, is thinking of doing just that.

It looks like he'll be doing a lot of talking across the floor, encouraging both sides to join him in the walk through the crisis.

Recently, I learned that we must forge strategies that enable us to walk thru crisis to the finish.
