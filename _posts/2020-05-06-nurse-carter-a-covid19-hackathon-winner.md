So, when I built [Nurse Carter](https://irwinium.wordpress.com/2017/01/26/who-is-nurse-carter/) years ago, I got the data from the Ministry of Health's website in Trinidad and Tobago. I hadn't updated the data since. Also, I built it with version 3 of the Microsoft Bot Framework.

Bot Framework updated a lot since then, and so did the health facility schedule. I took the opportunity to hit two birds with one code. I updated to the latest bot framework bits, changed from Node to dotnet and updated the health facility data.

To make it COVID-19 relevant, I included information about that as a menu option in Nurse Carter.

When I first did Nurse Carter, I feel like I had a lot more time - lol, I did because I was on "paternity leave" (it's regular vacation I'm calling that). Now, in snatches of time, I found myself thinking "this is rell work!"

Nevertheless, I got to the submission line and Nurse Carter to a [devpost hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/nurse-carter) and it was one of the top projects out of 1500 that were submitted! COVID-19 has brought a lot of heartache but I'm hoping that innovative approaches like Nurse Carter get more and more opportunities to deliver meaningful value in people's lives.
