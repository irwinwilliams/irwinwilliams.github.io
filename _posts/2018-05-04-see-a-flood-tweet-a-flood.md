Brandon was a student of mine in 2016. He did the Cloud Technologies course as an elective in his GIS programme at UWI.

During the course, one of the assignments is to develop a proposal for a cloud service. The proposal should address service model, delivery model and deployment. It also needs to talk about how each of the [5 characteristics](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2011/10/final-version-nist-cloud-computing-definition-published) of cloud services would be delivered.

Brandon and his team proposed flood identification as a service.Â  That is, it would grab user generated content and use that to identify if floods are happening in real time. After the proposal, he continued refining the proposal and is now testing it. He published this video to explain how it works:

Good job, Brandon!
