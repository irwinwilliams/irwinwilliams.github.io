I'm lecturing at the University of the West Indies this year.  I'll be teaching the MSc. course in Cloud Technologies.  This year, I'll be working along with Alysia Huggins. She'll be bringing expertise in distributed systems to the course, but not just that, some very cool approaches.

- We're looking to have more interaction from professionals, so there'll be in-class Skyping, interviews and assignments that require our students to get out and look around at what's happening in the region 'round Cloud Technologies.

Their first assignment will be to take a look at IaaS and start to answer the question, "Is the West Indies ready for building/deploying it's own IaaS services"?
