I was on vacation over the 2016 Christmas period. At the office, we had recently concluded our Power Hour series for the year with an episode describing how we built a virtual assistant that made parliamentary recordings discoverable via Facebook messenger. 

We called that [Hansard Speaks](http://www.facebook.com/HansardSpeaks), and you can check out that episode [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zridSezl8Bk). 

So, I'm home thinking, 'what next?' when we had a new beginning of our own: my baby girl was born! Apart from the explosion of joy with her arrival, I was home for a month. 

_Mind you: I understand that paternity leave is officially 3 days in Trinidad & Tobago. My company, Teleios Systems gives us a week. So, my wife and I agreed that I'd augment that with 3 weeks of vacation. In the end, we're very glad we did._ 

Anyway, being home with baby, witnessing the pains, frustrations & gladness of interacting with our public health systems, gave me the idea for my next virtual assistant: [Nurse Carter](https://webchat.botframework.com/embed/nurse_carter?s=4y9Wrgr1qzY.cwA._CU.SuwPUszzPG2nyRVj2pQ0_N2lZrlxWeQ-M-Lnlb-p3xU). 

Nurse Carter is a virtual assistant that you can ask questions (kind of) and it will tell you when & where you can get access to various kinds of health services.  
A few years ago, I used the data located on the Trinidad and Tobago [Ministry of Health](http://health.gov.tt/)'s web pages as the base for a mobile app. I called the app, TT Health Facilities and I used it to list all the health facilities and the services they provided based on their schedule. So, I knew there was a place to retrieve this data from.

As we did when we built [Hansard Speaks](https://www.facebook.com/pg/HansardSpeaks/about/), I used the Microsoft Bot Framework, this time using NodeJS rather than C#. This one took a while to put together because crying baby trumps messy JavaScript. But it's finally done, and you can access it **[directly on  the web](https://webchat.botframework.com/embed/nurse_carter?s=4y9Wrgr1qzY.cwA._CU.SuwPUszzPG2nyRVj2pQ0_N2lZrlxWeQ-M-Lnlb-p3xU) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Nurse-Carter-957955451003430/).**

This was another opportunity to get into the technology around Lucene and that type of search experience, everything else was mostly hacking around in Node. I guess I'm sort of working my way up towards more natural language interactions. So maybe next time I'll use Microsoft's Cognitive Services' [Language Understanding Intelligent Service](https://www.luis.ai/).
