You can place an order via WhatsApp for groceries in Trinidad & Tobago now. From one of the largest chains in the country.

Many government agencies are available in a real-time way on social media. Providing updates of a COVID and even non-COVID nature

A local bank has started to enable sending of money that the recipient has access to in 1 day, down from 4 to 5. The others, I expect are sure to follow.

I'm here for all of it. Maybe this activity is just merchants and other service providers responding to the change in environment. Everyone's online, and the only way to get people to interact meaningfully with your service is by meeting them where they are at.

For now, I'll list these services as I hear about them. I won't celebrate too loudly, because, you know, many people have been clamoring for this for a long time.
