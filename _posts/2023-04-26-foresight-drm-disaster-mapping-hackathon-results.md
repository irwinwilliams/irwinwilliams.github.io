1. Project Ignite features an interactive dashboard that tracks and learns from bushfires using historical, present, and futuristic data. By incorporating machine learning and data visualization technologies, the dashboard continually adapts and improves, making it a valuable resource for tracking and learning from bushfires across the Caribbean.

3. EmergencyRoute utilizes cutting-edge geospatial technologies like Geoserver and LeafletJS to improve emergency response during disasters like hurricanes. This web application tracks hurricane movement, provides optimized routing options for emergency responders, and offers post-disaster simulations to better prepare for future events.

5. SoilSafe is a web-based solution that maps and plans soil conservation efforts in the Bahamas based on dominant soil types, rainfall, and tropical cyclone events. The project aims to help develop strategies to reduce the impact of natural disasters in the region, with a possible real-time collaboration feature for faster decision-making during disaster events.

7. Prudence is a disaster readiness web app designed to aid the island of Nassau in the Bahamas during hurricane events. The app focuses on addressing human and social impacts by providing crucial information and facilitating communication between emergency responders and citizens in need, ultimately helping to save lives and mitigate the impacts of hurricanes.

9. GIS Event Tracker & Dashboard is a platform that offers real-time updates on events and incidents, enabling users to prepare for and respond to disasters more effectively. This dashboard provides up-to-the-minute information on the ongoing impact of natural disasters, helping communities stay informed and react accordingly.
