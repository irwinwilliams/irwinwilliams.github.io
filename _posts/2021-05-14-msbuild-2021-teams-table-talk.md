I saw this tweet 👆🏾 and thought, I should send a topic.

Since I've been recently [building](https://irwinium.wordpress.com/2019/10/19/the-tweetwhisperer/) [bots](https://irwinium.wordpress.com/2020/05/06/nurse-carter-a-covid19-hackathon-winner/) and extensions in [Teams](https://irwinium.wordpress.com/2020/10/19/agents-of-teams/) I focused my topic on just that - extending Teams. I hadn't heard about table talks, but Microsoft started making them possible in a few conferences before Build.

My topic was accepted, and along with [Erik Kleefeldt](https://erik365.blog/2021/05/13/co-hosting-microsoft-build-2021-table-topic-extending-the-microsoft-teams-experience-con044/), we'll be hosting a table talk on "Extending the Microsoft Teams Experience"

Erik and I have met a few times and we're excited to share the experience. Table Talks are meant to be like those hallway conversations you might have on your way to a session about topics you dig. They should be welcoming, open and good-natured, really.

This should be fun!
