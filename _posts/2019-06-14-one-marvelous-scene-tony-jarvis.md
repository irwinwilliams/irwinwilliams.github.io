My video editing skills are what you might call, "Hello World" level. So, I'm not interested in bringing down the average as it were, in terms of the quality content over on the official "[One Marvelous Scene](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRwZnfsdoK8aStoiK93j2F2ac-4yac5ZY)" playlist on YouTube.

I dig what those storytellers did a lot. But as far as I can tell, even though there are 67 videos on that list, they missed a key one. It was from when Tony had returned home in Iron Man 1 and was building out the new suit, working with Jarvis.

Back when IM1 came out, I remember being delighted by the movie, just for the flow of it, just as a young developer then, seeing a portrayal of a "good programmer" was refreshing. And he was getting things wrong. Making measuring mistakes or pushing things out too quickly. He had to return to the drawing board a lot. It was messy. Just like writing code.

And while doing this, he was working along with Jarvis. An AI helper with "personality". One that he could talk to in a normal way and move his work along.

In 2008, that was still viewed as fanciful, in terms of a developer experience, but even then I was somewhat seriously considering its potential, which is why I even asked about voice commands for VS on StackOverflow üëáüèæ

Jump forward to 2019 and bot framework is a thing, the [StackOverflow bot](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/25/can-use-new-stack-overflow-bot-microsoft/) is also a thing and Team Visual Studio introduced IntelliCode as this year's build conference.

So, as a scene in a movie, Tony talking with Jarvis helps us understand Tony's own creative process, but for me, it gave glimpses into the near future for how I could be building applications. And that's marvelous.
