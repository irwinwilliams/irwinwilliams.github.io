When I sat at the table at PanHack today, I had a vague, familiar sense of dread.

It's similar to that feeling you get when you haven't done a lap of the Queen's Park Savannah for two weeks, and you're facing it at noon.  You can do it, but should you?

With just a few hours to spend figuring out what to conceptualize, I spent most of it essentially coming up with a mashup of Ingress, Pokemon Go and Steel Pan History.  I ended writing very little code, and essentially filling out a concept document.

PanHack was a small affair this year. It was the first time such an event had taken place. Hosted by <a href="http://www.LizMannette.com" target="_blank">Elizabeth</a> it was a movement towards encouraging digital innovation with respect to the Steel Pan.

As hackathons go, it is very possible that the code we had ideas to write will never see the light of day. So instead, I hope that the participants present today will break down their solutions into executable bits so that we can report next year that progress was had because we tackled the areas that we could have with whatever resources were available.
