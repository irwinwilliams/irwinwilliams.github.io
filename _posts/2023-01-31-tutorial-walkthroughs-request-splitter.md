I'm teaching the graduate level [distributed computer systems course](https://sta.uwi.edu/fst/dcit/content/comp6601) from the University of the West Indies' MSc program in Computer Science.

We're using several reference texts including [Designing Distributed Systems - by Brendan Burns](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Distributed-Systems-Patterns-Paradigms/dp/1491983647?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=iwillwrite-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=9b4cb437458d990c98babae7a9f941ed&camp=1789&creative=9325). Burns has provided several examples and walkthroughs related to patterns in distributed systems.

Sometimes, when using/attempting tutorials, technologies change and the guidance encoded into the tutorial gets out of date. So, it's important that if a bit of content has been around for a few years that you confirm things work how they should. Especially when cloud services are involved. The video below captures how the particular tutorial, a request splitter should work, with [slight fixes](https://github.com/brendandburns/designing-distributed-systems-labs/pull/9) to update the script.

[Find the tutorial here](https://github.com/brendandburns/designing-distributed-systems-labs/tree/master/1.%20Single%20Node%20Pattern/1.1.%20Request%20Splitter).
