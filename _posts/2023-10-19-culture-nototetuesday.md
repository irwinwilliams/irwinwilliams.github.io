Or, how we created a cultural artifact by burning.

The algos suggested I check out "Let It Burn" by Shaboozey.

[This video is the intersection of many cool things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPaJ87tvOZw).

I've listened to it too many times already. But from the very first listen, it reminded me of something my old team built more than a decade ago.

We had been going through a series of unpleasantness that left the team in a generally sour disposition. Everybody was still working but the pallor was palpable. Someone recognized that we had to do something to reclaim the vibes, get our mojo back and move on.

So, we lit a fire.

On a random Tuesday, we were called into a meeting and asked to write on strips of paper, things that we were aggrieved about. Dutifully, we complied, and when done, we went outside, lit a small fire in a Crix tin and dropped in our jottings.

#NoToteTuesday was created.

We all agreed that we would let those feelings dissipate in the smoke and especially on Tuesdays try to ensure that whatever was bothering us would be resolved or at least set aside so we could build free, and code hard.

Shaboozey's lyrics perfectly match what we tried to accomplish.

**Let It Burn**

> \[Intro\]  
> I know he hurt you bad but you won't come clean  
> They say time heals all but the pain runs way too deep  
> Lied to yourself so much that you started to believe  
> That love doesn't last cause that's all you've ever seen
> 
> \[Chorus\]  
> Grab the matches  
> Start a fire  
> Throw the memories in the flames its behind us  
> See the gold in the red new horizons  
> Let it burn  
> Let it burn
> 
> \[Verse 1\]  
> So run for the hills baby don't look back when you leave  
> There's a train headed wеst move along you got somewherе to be  
> Watch your step  
> Coming off of the life that you left  
> Break the rules, cross a line, make a mess  
> This could be the only chance that you get
> 
> \[Chorus\]  
> Grab the matches  
> Start a fire  
> Throw the memories in the flames its behind us  
> See the gold in the red new horizons  
> Let it burn  
> Let it burn
