Started back with the UWI Cloud Technologies course today. This class was an Introduction to Cloud generally, with some conversation about the course outline and expectations for assignments.

We still in the process of confirming the course outline, so I'll share that next week. But I used [the slides](https://github.com/irwinwilliams/computerscience/tree/master/Complimentary%20Course%20Content/Module1/Lessons) from the technical resources provided by the Azure Computer Science module on cloud technology.

On my way to class I met up with Naresh who runs the UWI's Department of Computing and Information Technology servers. He gave me a quick tour of their deployment. I'm looking forward to him sharing some stories from setting up that environment in our IaaS classes in a few weeks.

Recommended reading for today's class is [Consumption Economics: The New Rules of Tech](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984213031/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0984213031&linkCode=as2&tag=cloudtech1-20&linkId=69c310b5fdec02e19f4395b7b8e102dd)![](//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=cloudtech1-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0984213031)
