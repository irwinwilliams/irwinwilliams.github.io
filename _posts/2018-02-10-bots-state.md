Ok, in 2016/2017 these were the bots I made:

Nurse Carter

Hansard Speaks

Time for Water

For some reason, I feel like there were more. Most likely, that's because of perhaps just iterating on those above. I did make a few PoCs for work, like collaborating on the Teleios Code Jam one with our intern at the time, Joshua.

I also made a few ones we used for demos with clients, those put together things like QuikWorx, our low code solution creator at Teleios with SharePoint and Cortana.

This year, there are a few I'm going to go after in addition to iterating on the ones above. A friend of mine asked me to make a hybrid QnA CUI application. This [tweet](https://twitter.com/GaryPretty/status/962084658325409792) by Gary Pretty about a [new way to sync QnAs](https://github.com/garypretty/qnamaker-sync) might bring that back up.

My next new bot will be one that uses the Consumer Affairs Division data in some way. I hope to finish that over this long weekend in Trinidad.

One of the changes I've not been on top of have been to the Microsoft Bot Framework.  They've gone to [General Availability](https://blog.botframework.com/2017/12/13/conversational-bots-deep-dive-whats-new-general-availability-azure-bot-service-language-understanding/) and bots on the bot framework developer portal need to be moved over to the azure portal by March 31.  I'll both move and update dependencies with the move to keep current with how to do things on the framework.

So, that's it. I hope for more collaborations with the updates this year and perhaps more frequent updates.
