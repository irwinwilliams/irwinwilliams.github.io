For #DevFestCarib this year, I wanted to talk about stories and some examples of how they impacted me. So, I came up this presentation that looked at three sets of stories.

"Press Here" is about making an metaverse app based on a book of the same name.

"Fusion" features another metaverse app, this time a virtual trophy based on the Fusion Virtual 7 series.

And I ended by celebrating how our team at Teleios evolved the Power Hour meeting we had in a very beneficial way to grab back some of the serendipity that attended working in person.

Overall, I wanted to leave the idea that some stories can be building blocks, they can inspire brand new ideas and journeys, and thus, essential to our own building in the region are people telling developer stories of all sorts.
