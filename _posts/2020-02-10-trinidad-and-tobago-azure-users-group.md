We're having the first of many (I hope) Microsoft Azure users meeting this Thursday (February 13).

How do you Azure?

I'm excited by this because here in Trinidad, I'm grateful that in and around Teleios, we've been using Azure for years, and I've often wondered about who else around us is learning, playing and building on the platform. [Nigel Sammy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigelpsammy), [Christian Anton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christiananton/) and I will be sharing on Azure in general, Azure DevOps and Azure Arc. It'll be a really nice spread of features, from the novel to the staid.

So, convince you're boss, if you're interested, we'll be at the Microsoft Office on Mucurapo Road, from 9:00 to 11:00 am.

The event is free, so's the breakfast and you can [register here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/trinidad-and-tobago-azure-user-group-first-meetup-tickets-93057480429).
