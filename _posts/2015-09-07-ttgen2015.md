We successfully wrapped up covering another set of elections. This time, closer to home. In Trinidad and Tobago together with Solution by Simulation, we provided data capture, analysis and reporting for the General Elections on September 7. I built specialized tools for us to capture and make the data available via API. From there, the visualization experts TV6 hired displayed the info in real time. It was great building and supporting this data capture for such an important event.
