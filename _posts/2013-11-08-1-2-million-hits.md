<h1>On Monday 4th November Trinidad &amp; Tobago featured its fourth set of elections for the year.</h1>
<div class="post-bodycopy cf">

Those elections were:
<ol>
	<li>The Tobago House of Assembly Elections – January 21</li>
	<li>The Chaguanas West By-Election – July 29</li>
	<li>The Trinidad &amp; Tobago Local Government Elections – October 21</li>
	<li>The St. Joseph By-Election – November 4</li>
</ol>
I worked with <a title="Solution By Simulation" href="http://www.solutionbysimulation.com/" target="_blank">Solutions By Simulations </a>again to deliver <a title="coverage of the elections" href="http://politicalsimulations.com/wp/?p=217" target="_blank">coverage of the elections</a>, and taking our learnings from Chaguanas West and the LGE, it was definitely our most successful outing!
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://irwinium.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/stjosephmap1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-43" src="https://irwinium.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/stjosephmap1.jpg?w=300" alt="stjosephmap[1]" width="300" height="209" /></a></p>
The results display was an automatically updated map of St. Joseph, with twitter providing the numbers as the occurred, too.

You could have kept track of the overall numbers by taking a look at the totals on the bottom.

We unveiled the feature promptly at six,

And from then til about 10pm we were the place to get information as quickly and reliably as possible.  We’ve been able to confirm, through a number of sources that most of the media houses covering the event had an eye on what we were doing.

Both the Trinidad Guardian &amp; the Trinidad Express (who together have <a title="more than half" href="http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/Express-tops-all-in-readership-223229471.html" target="_blank">more than half </a>the daily readership in Trinidad and Tobago were both using the results we generated.

The night was not without it’s challenges as the popularity of the service eventually brought the site to its knees a few times and our data gatherers had to resort to more prehistoric ways of getting data to us that we would have liked. Overall though, the comments we received were mostly positive and we’re definitely looking for ways to make it better and more robust!
