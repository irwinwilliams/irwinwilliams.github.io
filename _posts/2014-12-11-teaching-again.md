Last year, I taught three courses.

- Intro to Mobile Applications
- Software Engineering
- Cloud Technologies

I hadn't done any lecturing for a while, and the opportunities came around fairly suddenly, but it was good to be back in class and sharing experiences. Mobile Apps & Software Engineering were taught at the University of Trinidad & Tobago.

I've found that interacting with the students and faculty is excellent for understanding how important the relationship between industry & practitioners and institutions can be.

That's it for now, but I'll write on Cloud Technologies another time.
