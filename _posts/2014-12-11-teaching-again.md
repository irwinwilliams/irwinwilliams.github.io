Last year, I taught three courses.
<ul>
	<li>Intro to Mobile Applications</li>
	<li>Software Engineering</li>
	<li>Cloud Technologies</li>
</ul>
I hadn't done any lecturing for a while, and the opportunities came around fairly suddenly, but it was good to be back in class and sharing experiences. Mobile Apps &amp; Software Engineering were taught at the University of Trinidad &amp; Tobago.

I've found that interacting with the students and faculty is excellent for understanding how important the relationship between industry &amp; practitioners and institutions can be.

That's it for now, but I'll write on Cloud Technologies another time.
