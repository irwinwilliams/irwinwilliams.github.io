Just a small note to say I've added in to Nurse Carter the ability to provide information about shelters and emergency contact numbers.

Of course, there's a wider story around this. About #OpenData and being able to leverage that for future needs. But I won't go in to that now.

I did some scrounging around online, found the PDFs and stored them on github in case the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management's site goes down during build up to a hurricane again. Â And that's about it.
